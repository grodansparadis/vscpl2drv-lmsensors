This is a Level II driver for the linux lmsensors interface

The driver read the sensor values from the textfiles and convert the 
values in it to events at periodic intervals. 

Variables 
=========
A driver is opened with a supplied prefix. This prefix is added in front of
the variable name described below. For example if a prefix "cpucore1" is 
supplied the the variables read would be lmsensor1_numberffsensors, 
cpucore1_guid0, cpucore1_path0 and so on.

_numberofsensors - Type=integer. This is the number of sensors that the driver is supposed
to read. Sensors are numbered staring from zero. 

_guidn - Type=guid. GUID for sensor n. guid0, guid1, guid2 etc
_pathn - Type=string. Path to value for example 
          /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input
         which is CPU temp for core 1 on the system this is written at.
_intervaln - Type=integer. Interval in Seconds the event should be sent out. Zero disables.
_vscpclassn  - Type=integer. VSCP_CLASS Typically = 10, CLASS=10 Measurement
_vscptypen   - Type=integer. VSCP_TYPE
_datacodingn - Type=integer. Coding for the value (databyte 0). See section 8 in specification.
_dividen     - Type=integer. Divide value with this integer. Default is 1.
_multiplyn   - Type=integer. Multiply value with this integer. Default is 1.
